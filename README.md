# Chess-Game

The **“Half-Chess”** project is a **full-stack .NET** application that combines a **WinForms client**, an **ASP.NET Core Web API server**, and a **SQL Server database**. It implements a shortened chess variant on an 8×4 board (the right half of a standard chessboard), where each side has a King, Bishop, Knight, Rook, and four pawns. The game follows the standard chess rules with a per-turn timer, and a player who runs out of time loses. The **client side (WinForms)** manages the graphical board, game logic, timers, move and check animations, and freehand drawing tools for annotations. The **server side (ASP.NET Core Web API)** handles communication with clients, manages player and game records in the **SQL Server database** through Entity Framework Core, and generates random legal moves as the opponent’s responses. The database serves as a central repository for players and games, allowing tracking and storage of all relevant information.
